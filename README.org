#+TITLE: The L₃ project

* Introduction

Welcome to the L₃ project, composed of an L₃ compiler, a virtual machine, a library and a few example programs. The directories are laid out as follows:

  - =compiler= :: contains the source code of the L₃ compiler,

  - =library= :: contains the source code of the L₃ library,

  - =examples= :: contains a few example L₃ programs and benchmarks.

Most of these directories contain a =README= file with further information.
